### about the project
In this project, it is a frontend test case that is divided into certain parts.

1) add section
Here we create a user object. There are parts such as name, city, country, email and we fill them according to certain rules and save them in local storage.

2) searhc and list
We can search for a value over the json data we have and list them in the simple and advanced sections.
We give the user only 3 of the items searched in the basic part.

In the other part, we can reach the key-word you want by making different listings according to the alphabetic order of the key-words and names entered for the input.

3) footer-slider
There is also a part in the project in the form of a carousel written with the footer and the react-slick library.
